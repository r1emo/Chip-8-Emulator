Chip 8 Emulator written in C for a fun personal project.

Very much a work in progress and it's probably an ugly mess since
it's my first time doing a lot of this stuff. Might port to an iOS app
one day and will probably work on Linux and Windows versions someday.

TODO (ramblings):
- Switch opcode function names to hex values instead of rough description (cleaner)
- Optimize for low memory usage (more efficient types)
- Better error handling (add any form of error handling)
- Finish adding Super Chip 8 support (I'm lazy and want to do gameboy)
